/**
 * A complex optimization test that enables developers to determine the optimal cutoff point for using maps to store
 * node children. Specifically, this helps determine the most efficient balance between load time and search time for
 * pkgnx. Nodes with the cutoff or more children will use a map internally whereas those below the cutoff will use an
 * array and binary searching. The results, as of v1.2.0, say that 41 children is the optimal cutoff. Be careful with
 * this benchmark, it can easily take a very long time.
